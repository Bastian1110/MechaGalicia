The Mecha-Galicia-01 is a teleoperated car that was created with the purpose of being  controlled  by the movement of a hand remotely.
It can be used to automate different processes in the industry. Every pose of the hand is going to send a request to the robot, in this case the requests are:  move forward, left, right or regulate its velocity. It can be controlled by using a web page that activates the webcam and allows the user to control the Mecha-Galicia-01.
